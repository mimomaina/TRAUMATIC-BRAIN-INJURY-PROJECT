# TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PROJECT(TBI)
PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project presents an in-depth analysis of a dataset focused on Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The data explores various factors contributing to TBI incidents, specifically in relation to military personnel, the age groups affected, and the years of injury.The goal of this project is to gain insights into how TBI cases vary across these dimensions and help inform strategies for prevention and treatment in specific high-risk groups.

TOOLS 

PowerBi-visualization - three dashboards been used to cater for the three datasets separately.We used slicers,stacked line charts,a horizontal bar graph and a donut chart.
Data cleaning-Identified and addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and mislabeled data types.
SQL- Used for data manipulation
	  -Used for data extraction
   
CHALLENGES

We experienced some difficulty coming up with a visualization method as the 3 datasets were related to each other in few ways. Therefore,we decided to have three dashboards ,one for each dataset, so as to broadly analyze each aspect.

INSIGHTS/RESULTS

 After analyzing the data, the following insights were drawn:
- The greatest cause of TBI  is unintentional falls.However,for people between 15 to 34, motor vehicle crashes are the greatest contributors of brain injuries.
- The Airforce had the least severe cases of brain injuries.
- There has been an exponential growth in brain injuries over the years.The number who get into emergency treatment has risen exponentially. The same applies to the number of those hospitalized. The number of deaths from TBI has been steady all through.
These are just but a few of the findings.
Further detailed findings are included in the analysis notebook, along with visualizations and discussions. To get more insights from the dashboard, feel to click the slicers or horizontal bar graphs to compare various attributes.

RECOMMENDATIONS

From the above findings we advice: 
-That the military, in general, should take whatever precautionary measures the Air Force has taken to prevent situations or accidents that may lead to brain injuries.
-For caution to be taken, especially with children and the elderly, to prevent unintentional falls. 
-Pedestrians and motorists to be careful on the roads . The authorities should also be pro active in ensuring the roads are safe and traffic rules are followed to the latter.
-Incase of an accident, kindly seek medical attention.
